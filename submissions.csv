Princess Elissa of Treiaul has never fit the mold of royal perfection. She prefers the forest to the throne room, her bow to the delicate trappings of court life. But when Prince Hayward of Aasleagh arrives to negotiate a fragile peace treaty, she’s ordered to play the gracious host to the human she’s been raised to despise.

Hayward is no stranger to being underestimated — the youngest of his brothers and a seasoned soldier, he’s spent his life carving out a place for himself. He enters elven territory with low expectations and party of men mostly chosen by his father who he doesn’t trust, prepared to endure the cold shoulder of a princess who sees him as the enemy.

But what neither of them anticipates is the undeniable pull between them. Their sharp words turn into lingering glances, and every clash of wills ignites something far more dangerous than hatred. As their chemistry simmers, Hayward becomes the unexpected catalyst for Elissa to embrace her wild heart and for her people to see the looming human threat for what it truly is.

With tensions rising and kingdoms on the brink of war, their forbidden connection might either shatter the fragile hope of peace — or forge a love powerful enough to change the fate of their realms forever.

For over a century, his name was erased, his legend reduced to whispers.

In modern-day Seville, a woman known only as White Lotus rules the city’s underworld with calm authority and ruthless precision, unaware that her fate is tied to ancient sigils long buried beneath the streets she controls.

Christmas in Paris, 1900. Beneath the glittering lights of the World’s Fair and the velvet haze of the Palais Rose, Celestine reigns as the most enchanting courtesan in the city—desired, celebrated, and hopelessly trapped in a life she never truly chose.

Adrien Louis, a grieving widower and wealthy merchant, has closed his heart to the world. His cold Parisian townhouse mirrors the life he leads—silent, empty, untouched since the tragedy that shattered him four years ago.

When a pair of noisy sisters in the neighboring townhouse set their sights on the handsome Monsieur Louis, he makes a desperate, almost absurd, decision: he hires Celestine to pose as his companion for Christmas dinner.

What begins as a convenient arrangement soon reveals unexpected truths. Behind Celestine’s shimmering façade is a woman yearning for freedom. Behind Adrien’s sorrow lies a man still capable of profound love.

As Paris glows with holiday magic and Christmas cheer, an unlikely connection sparks, one that neither of them believes they deserve, yet both are powerless to resist.

But love in the City of Light has a way of exposing everything: longing, fear, hope… and the courage to imagine a different life.

Alone, hungry, and hunted, his odds are razor-thin.

Driven by sheer determination, James claws his way back from the edge of starvation until he crosses paths with a battle-hardened trader with violence carved into his past and power bound into his skin.

Under Dayne's guidance, James begins to transform from desperate survivor to determined apprentice, finding purpose in this harsh new reality.

But when northern raiders threaten the settlements and war looms on the horizon, James faces an impossible choice: keep searching for a way back to a world that may no longer exist, or embrace the strength this harsh realm demands and fight for the life he's building.

In a world where survival isn't enough, who will James choose to become?

Lost Between Twin Moons is the first book in a dark fantasy series where growth is earned through suffering and strength is forged from loss. Perfect for readers who love gritty world-building, gut-wrenching stakes, and protagonists who are broken before they can rise.

Fair warning: This is Book 1 of a slow-burn transformation arc. James's journey to power begins with devastation.","Find a way home or survive long enough to make this world home.","None","","None","Level 2 (moderate themes)","Violence ","https://a.co/d/h9mSDRn","N/A","I agree","I understand","",""

The dead don’t steal. They trade.

Every Samhain, Isolde “Izzy” Vela leaves the same offerings on her family’s graves: mezcal, rosemary, a cigarette, and a letter she never sends. She knows the rules—never ask for more than one secret, never read the book aloud, never check the graves at dawn—but this year, the dead are greedy. The offerings vanish before midnight. The Book of Given Names writes itself in her ancestors’ handwriting, its pages filled with confessions that rewrite her memories. And the black marigolds on Luz’s grave bloom only for those who don’t know they’re dead.

When a skeptical journalist, Dante Morales, arrives to expose the town’s “haunted” tourism scams, he catches Izzy pulling a locket from her sister’s sealed casket. But the real fraud isn’t the graves—it’s the lie Izzy tells herself to keep breathing. Because the Collector is coming for the last piece of her: the name she buried herself under.

Now, with the book’s ink bleeding into her veins and the tide pools whispering in a language only she understands, Izzy must decide: Is she the girl who drowned, the ghost who got away, or the monster the dead made her?

A haunting, lyrical tale of memory as currency, grief as a bargain, and the lies we tell to stay alive—even when we’re not.","The dead don’t steal.
