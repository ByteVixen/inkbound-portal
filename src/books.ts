She prefers the forest to the throne room, her bow to the delicate trappings of court life. But when Prince Hayward of Aasleagh arrives to negotiate a fragile peace treaty, she’s ordered to play the gracious host to the human she’s been raised to despise.\n\nHayward is no stranger to being underestimated — the youngest of his brothers and a seasoned soldier, he’s spent his life carving out a place for himself. He enters elven territory with low expectations and party of men mostly chosen by his father who he doesn’t trust, prepared to endure the cold shoulder of a princess who sees him as the enemy.\n\nBut what neither of them anticipates is the undeniable pull between them. Their sharp words turn into lingering glances, and every clash of wills ignites something far more dangerous than hatred. As their chemistry simmers, Hayward becomes the unexpected catalyst for Elissa to embrace her wild heart and for her people to see the looming human threat for what it truly is.\n\nWith tensions rising and kingdoms on the brink of war, their forbidden connection might either shatter the fragile hope of peace — or forge a love powerful enough to change the fate of their realms forever.\n\nThis romantasy debut is a tale of passion, prejudice, and the power of choosing love in a world that demands war.",

When she starts dating their best friend, they back off for the first time, giving her room to breathe but also making her less cautious. After a terrifying and nearly tragic encounter while she’s out alone, her parents hire a bodyguard.\nJamie is more than happy to accept the job. Not only does it give him the routine he craves, he enjoys spending time with Layla a little too much. Although their chemistry is immediate, loving her isn’t a risk he’s prepared to take. Experience has taught him it always leads to disappointment or pain.\nThough they deny it, and Layla’s father forbids it, they fall hard for each other.\nBut fear keeps them apart. She finds herself in a new relationship she didn’t want and he realizes he’s found a family he’ll do anything to keep.\nTake It Back Then features some strong language and explicit sex scenes, as well as scenes involving kidnapping, SA intent, and death that can be upsetting or triggering to some.",

So when a gorgeous stranger offers her food and a place to stay in exchange for help around his colony's farm, she's hardly in a position to say no. The farm may be her chance to finally have someplace permanent to call home. But the seemingly idyllic town has secrets, and it soon becomes clear that not everyone here is happy with her arrival….\n\nAs the leader of his people, Matt has always been strict about ensuring no one learns too much about who - and what - they are. The second he meets Calli, his carefully constructed rules no longer apply. Calli is his - he's as sure of it as his wolf is. Matt's need to protect her is tested as Calli's own past threatens to haunt her…and someone lurking in the shadows promises to destroy them both.",

They trade.\n\nEvery Samhain, Isolde “Izzy” Vela leaves the same offerings on her family’s graves: mezcal, rosemary, a cigarette, and a letter she never sends. She knows the rules—never ask for more than one secret, never read the book aloud, never check the graves at dawn—but this year, the dead are greedy. The offerings vanish before midnight. The Book of Given Names writes itself in her ancestors’ handwriting, its pages filled with confessions that rewrite her memories. And the black marigolds on Luz’s grave bloom only for those who don’t know they’re dead.\n\nWhen a skeptical journalist, Dante Morales, arrives to expose the town’s “haunted” tourism scams, he catches Izzy pulling a locket from her sister’s sealed casket. But the real fraud isn’t the graves—it’s the lie Izzy tells herself to keep breathing. Because the Collector is coming for the last piece of her: the name she buried herself under.\n\nNow, with the book’s ink bleeding into her veins and the tide pools whispering in a language only she understands, Izzy must decide: Is she the girl who drowned, the ghost who got away, or the monster the dead made her?\n\nA haunting, lyrical tale of memory as currency, grief as a bargain, and the lies we tell to stay alive—even when we’re not.",
