              Inkbound Bookshop is a real-world haven for stories and storytellers, tucked away in the heart of Gort, Co. Galway. Founded by me — Amanda, a lifelong local from the Ardrahan–Peterswell area — Inkbound is the kind of space I always wished existed growing up. Despite Gort’s deep literary ties (WB Yeats, anyone?), it never had a bookshop. I wanted to change that.

              Since I was a child, I’ve dreamed of creating a bookshop that felt like stepping through a portal — a place where magic lives on every shelf. Books have always been my way into other worlds, and Inkbound is my way of bringing those worlds to life for others.

              We champion indie authors, celebrate the self-published and the strange, and build a community where no reader or writer is left out. Here, stories are currency, quests are real, and every book has the potential to change someone’s world.
